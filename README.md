# Building (OSX)
Make sure to clone recursively to pick up the submodules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/johnoneil/dss.git
```
You should now have an xcode project at ```dss/demo/proj.macosx/```
Tested on XCode 10.3 in macOS 10.14.5

# Precompiled binaries
There are pre-built packages for debug and release builds at ```dss/demo/proj.macosx/bin```.
You should be able to run them by command line via:
```
./dss/demo/proj.macosx/bin/Debug/demo_macosx.app/Contents/MacOS/demo_macosx
```
